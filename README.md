# Community Detection in Financial Networks for AML Using GNNs

# 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting money laundering activities using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), specifically Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT). The goal is to analyze financial transactions using graph-based community detection and anomaly detection techniques to identify suspicious activities.

# 🔍 Key Features

Graph Construction: Converts transaction data into a graph-based structure.

Community Detection: Uses Louvain clustering to detect tightly-knit groups.

GNN-Based Training: Implements GCN & GAT for learning embeddings.

Fraud Detection:

Uses Isolation Forest to detect anomalies in transaction patterns.

Applies Z-score analysis to flag transactions with unusual amounts.

# 📊 Results & Visualization

Transaction Networks: Displays detected communities and suspicious nodes.

Fraud Highlighting: Fraudulent transactions are highlighted based on the anomaly scores.

Dynamic Filtering: Select specific communities for deeper inspection.

# 📌 Future Enhancements

🛠 Deploying as a Web App for real-time fraud detection.

🔍 Enhancing GNN Architecture for improved feature learning.

📉 Integrating Reinforcement Learning to adapt to evolving fraud patterns.
